Theme: Keep It Alive

Ideas:
	Hands on Tower Defense/Hack and Slash protecting the heart from disease 										- Good Contender, maybe the scope is a bit too big
		Sanctum two but 2d-ish
	
	Stratego																										- Confusing for the time being, might be worth looking into
		Turn based, tile based, Stratego-esque rpg
	
	Space Invader																									- Easy, but might get boring quickly
	
	Orbital Defense																									- "eh.."
		Earth is under attack you are part of an elite team
		Keep the earthlings alive
		
	Earth Defense																									- Its 'eh.."
		Earth is in its infancy, you need to keep them alive to progress the species
		Save it from a alien warrior race that wants to enslave them
	
	Immortality																										- It's alright
		You are cursed to stay alive forever, however your body does deteriorate
		You need to steal others live-force/flesh to keep looking like a human
		
		Or seek out immortality to stay alive forever
		
	
	Stockholm Syndrome - Prison break																				- Good Contender
		You were kidnapped and kept as a slave for some time
		The police arrested him and he got a life time in prison
		you NEED to break him out because you think he's fucking great
		You will stop at nothing
		
		Stealth game
		Hotline miami vibe
		or just fuck em up
		
	
	Making the best of something
		Carpe Diem or some shit
		
	Keeping the spirit of a crowd up																				- Maybe MC'ing for a band or stuff, might get very technical
	
	Keeping someone alive by helping him navigate a hazardous environment											- Real Time possibly, like a inverted "Death Run" Game mode
	
	Survival/Scavenging game																						- Stuck on an island or some shit, need to find food, water, warmth
	
	Keeping the cup half full																						- Very Simple, could be a puzzle game
	
	Necromancy																										- Kinda fun, might be a bit hard to keep interesting
		Survival/Escape game with necromancy as your power, keeping those you killed alive
		Start off on your own as a mage/witch being chased by a the public
		Take out some of the public to fight with 
	
	Guardian spirit																									- Very abstract, don't really wanna go the real life route
	
	Zombie survival																									- Been done to shit, might be annoying as it is a big escort mission essentially
		Protect your immune party member to help research
		
	Post-apocalype
		Wall-e Style
			Make the world live again by bringing a plant/orb/whatever to a certain place							- Could be fun
			
	1984																											- Big Brother Style, either kill the system or "mind control" everyone to not notice therefore
